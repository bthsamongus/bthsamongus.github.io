                <p>Club members need to fill out an Attendance form every time they attend a club meeting on Zoom.</p>
                <p>Attendance forms are only accepted when our inbox is open. You will be notified if we are currently not accepting forms when you try to submit one.</p>
                <p>Club members are required to attend the Zoom meeting for their Attendance form to be valid. Filling out the form and not attending the meeting will not get you credit.</p>

                    <h2># What will happen if I accidentally submit multiple forms?</h2>
                    <p>We will receive and review your forms like any other form. Sending in multiple attendance forms will not get you more club credits.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2># What do I do if I entered in the wrong information on a form?</h2>
                    <p>If your OSIS was entered correctly, just submit another attendance form using that OSIS and the correct information. The system will automatically fix your earlier mistake. If you are not sure if your OSIS was entered correctly, just submit another form and contact us.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2># What is the deadline for attendance forms?</h2>
                    <p>An executive will open up our inbox every time we have a meeting. You will then have until 11:59 PM on the same day to submit an attendance form. Club members are encouraged to submit a form as soon as they can so they won't forget about it and lose easy credits.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2># Why do I need to use my NYCDOE email?</h2>
                    <p>You are only allowed to use your NYCDOE email to enter our Zoom meetings. Zoom keeps track of the emails that people use to attend a meeting. Therefore, we will only accept an attendance form if the email written in the form is found on that Zoom log.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2># Do I need to submit an attendance form on Thursday if I already submitted one for Tuesday's meeting?</h2>
                    <p>If you are certain that you attended Tuesday's meeting and submitted an attendance form for that day, then you don't have to submit an attendance form for Thursday's meeting on the same week. If not, just submit another form.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2># Why isn't the form working for me even though it's working for others?</h2>
                    <p>Try refreshing the page, using a new browser, or using a new device. If none of those options work for you, calm down and take a deep breath. Wait a bit and try again later.</p>
